I've been told that the first blog post you ever make is probably going to be
bad. In keeping with that tradition:

My name's Johann. I'm currently writing this at 20:00 in my university's
Computer Science department after throwing out my old website's codebase -
it wasn't organised well at all and I could never reliably get it to run on
my local machine, so out with Jekyll and in with Vue.I'm not a web dev though.
Truth be told, I hadn't really anticipated building a new website (actually two,
check out [Kumomi Systems](https://kumomi-systems.org)), especially not during
my preparation for end of year exams (my bad...).

But I felt that I should do two things: Actually get a framework under my
belt - it's always a good skill to have - and make something to show off with.
My recent project has been
[Wakatiwai](https://kumomi-systems.org/#/projects/wakatiwai), and now that I'm
nearing the time when I can release this project out into the world, I wanted
to give it a proper place to be showcased.

So here I am. A developer, a photographer, and the maker of whatever this post
will be. I've been wanting to make a blog for a while, to do... something with.
Maybe I'm inspired a bit by my friend David, maybe I just want to have a more
productive way of saying something to the world without writing a letter and
burning it, spreading the ashes into the North Sea. I guess expect anything but
punctuality, I've no clue how often I'll actually write things on here, but
it ought to revolve around something philosophical, introspective, or maybe
just something I've done that I'm proud of.

That's about it really. Please do stick around, it'd be cool to know if
someone's reading my stuff (reach out, socials below!). Anyway, I'm going
home. The AC in here is way too high.

cool sweet,

Johann
