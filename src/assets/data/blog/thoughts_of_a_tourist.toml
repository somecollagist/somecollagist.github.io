How many people do you come across in a lifetime? Not just people you know, but people you pass by.
You can take a flight from Athens to Edinburgh, filled with people from all over the world and have
nothing in common with any of them - nationality, faith, final destination - except that you're
together in this moment.

It makes me wonder about all the people who have been a part of my life. Not just those close to me
now and in the past, but everyone. The teacher who made my parents and I wait in the rain until 8AM
sharp for breakfast club. The boy who I tutored GCSE maths for. The old friend who lived the next
street over who I haven't seen in nearly 10 years. What became of them? What will become of the
couple next to me once we land? Back to their lives of course - work, relaxation, sleep - things
that will probably never affect me, at least not directly.

Nearly two years ago, I went with a couple of friends to Berlin. I spoke the best German out of the
five of us, but not being wholly on board with the trip in the first place, I decided to stay on my
own in a youth hostel about a five minute walk away. By sheer happenstance, I met a guy called
Oleksandr, who's now one of my closest friends and someone I really look up to. Of the four friends
I travelled with, I don't speak with one anymore, and seldomly with two others. Did my friendship
with Oleksandr cost me that of Rose's? No, I don't think so. She's no longer a part of my life, but
her trip and my choices meant that he and I crossed paths. It means I went to Kraków in the snow,
had a direction to follow at uni, gave me hope for those in the face of conflict.

There's a thought experiment called \"Laplace's Demon\". Suppose you could build a computer that
knows the precise state of every particle in the universe and a flawless model describing those
particles. If the demon were real, could we see the past precisely as it was as dictated by our
model? Could we see the future with absolute certainty? In other words, are our choices governed not
by free will, but entirely the product of not just our past, rather the configuration of the
universe at it's inception? I'm not sure how to feel about all this. Sure, the surrender to the
Great Old One might feel liberating, but do I really want to be a program that doesn't know it's a
program? Maybe these words aren't mine. Maybe they're inspired by everyone around me. Maybe they're
just the logical consequence of the laws of physics.

Whichever way you cut it, I'm still here. Regardless of what I choose, if **I** even choose it,
there's still something here. Hofstadter's I-mode. *Cogito, ergo sum.* The ghost in the gears. Maybe
I am a product of autonomous energy, but if I am, then that makes me the product of everyone who
came before me and everyone who's life has touched mine in some way or another. And maybe I'm all
that plus something a little more.

Tu nous connaissas de Face.

Ευχαριστώ πολύ,
Johann
