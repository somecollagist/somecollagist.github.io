[bio]
bio = """
My interests as a programmer are mainly in **low-level** and **systems
programming**, though I'm also curious about **programming languages**,
**ternary computing**, and **game development**. I use **Arch** btw.

I'm the lead developer of [**Kumomi Systems**](https://kumomi-systems.org); an
organisation I founded in 2023 and where most of my **big projects** live. I am
also a member of the [**AVISI Group**](https://avisi.org.uk/), in which I have
worked on **emualtion research**.

More than just a computer nerd, I also like:
  - **Music** - both listening to it and playing **guitar**, **bass**, or
    **ukulele**.
  - **Stories** - I'm a big fan of any tall tale; some of my favourites are **Star
    Trek**, **Star Wars**, and **Lord of the Rings**.
  - **Languages** - I speak **German** and have a basis in **Latin**, but I'd love
    to also learn **Hungarian**, **te reo MƒÅori**, **Klingon**, and **modern
    Greek**.
  - **Travelling** - I love visiting new places and meeting new people; I can't
    wait to do more.
  - **Exercise** - My main sport is **Aikido**, but I also enjoy going to the
    **gym** and out on **walks**. It's a great way to clear my head and keep
    myself healthy.
  - **Games** - Some of my favourites are **Cribbage**, **Stellaris**, and
    **Dungeons and Dragons**.
